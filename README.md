# Symposion Project
This project has been developed for the "Software Engineering" course (Spring 2018) at University of Bologna, Bachelor in Computer Engineering.

The project consists of a complete application for sharing book reviews and book lists among subscribed users. Each user has a private space in which he can create and visualize its book lists (e.g favourite books, thriller books, books to read) and its book reviews. Moreover, he can access the book lists and book reviews saved from other users. There is also a public space, where users can interact each other publishing reviews, searching for books or public lists and possibly saving them. Finally, users can see book charts and report incorrect/offensive reviews.

The system is developed following the Model-View-Presenter pattern and it is subdivided between Client and Server. The Client-Server interaction is realized using the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) framework.

The following image illustrates the application structure.
